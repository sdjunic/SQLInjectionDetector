P0) - Think what to do with static fields, at least in OWSAP helper classes

1) 	- Add one global ValuesHolder map, for static fields
2) 	- Add handling for null pointer exception in dereferencing object field  { A a = null; read(a.b); }
3) DONE	- Make NullObj singleton, to ensure equality between VH maps after: { a = null; b = null; } and { a = null; b = a; } (also make only two static StringVal instances (safe and unsafe))
4)	- update GUI, to allow special methods safety change only for return type (consider allowing it for other arguments of type ClassValue)
5) DONE	- what to do with objects of unknown type, what to do with static fields, init blocks? - we DON'T WANT TO SUPPORT THIS, BECAUSE IT'S NOT TRIVIAL, BECAUSE OF EXECUTING FROM RISKY METHODS etc.
